      <li>In a bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside.</li>

      <li>In a third bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer for 2 minutes. With the mixer running, add the oil in a steady stream. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients alternating with the buttermilk mixture and beat until smooth. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans.</li>
      <li>Bake for 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the centre of each cake comes out clean. Let cool on a wire rack. Unmould and let cool completely.</li>

    <li>Cut each cake in half horizontally to have a total of 4 cake layers.</li>
    <li>Place one cake layer on a serving dish. Spread with one-quarter of the cream cheese whipped cream. Repeat with the remaining layers of cake and remaining cream. With the pastry bag, decorate the top of the cake with dots of the cream cheese whipped cream, small cubes of cake and cranberries. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
